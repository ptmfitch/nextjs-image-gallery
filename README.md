## Project: Pexels Image Gallery

This project is an image gallery application that fetches images from pexels.com. It features pagination and allows users to search for images based on the object in the picture (e.g., typing "cat" displays images of cats). The application was built using the following technologies and tools:

### 1. **Framework and Core**

- **NextJS**: A React framework that provides server-side rendering and static site generation, enhancing performance and SEO.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.

### 2. **Styling**

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that enables the creation of responsive and custom designs efficiently.

### 3. **Validation and Data Handling**

- **zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library used to ensure the correctness of data throughout the application.

- **plaiceholder**: A library for generating low-quality image placeholders, improving the user experience by providing a preview while images load.

- **envalid**: A library for validating environment variables to ensure the application configuration is correct and secure.
